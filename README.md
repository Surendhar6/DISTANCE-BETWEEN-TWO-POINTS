# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Create two list by naming them(eg. l1 and l2).
### Step 2: 
In the list , assign the values as the distance points.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118352907/230833845-6424f179-3249-4d2b-b8a6-3884e9a7aa38.png)
### Step 4: 
Using print statement, get the output of distance between two points.

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2)))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the python program for finding the distance between two points is executed successfully.
